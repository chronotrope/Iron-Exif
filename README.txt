<This is a work in progress>
Here's what I'm working towards:

Just another Exif Tool Wrapper
Written in IronPython
Built to scratch a certain itch.  Looks like quite a few folks are having this issue.  
Jpeg images edited in Photoshop result in images with all of the EXIF camera metadata being deleted.
Phil Harvey's tool already addresses this.  My goal is to make a nice GUI wrapper around the exiftool.exe
executable and make it easier for hobbyist photographers to transfer their camera's EXIF metadata
to their Photoshop-edited jpeg image.
Based on the awesome tool created by Phil Harvey! http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/
